\title{Interpolate barometric pressure with inverse distance weighting}
\usage{
marsInterpolateBaro(baro_psi, smp_id, weight, target_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{baro_psi}{vector, num, barometric pressures measured at the same timestamp}

\item{smp_id}{vector, chr, SMP IDs where the measurements took place}

\item{target_id}{chr, single SMP ID where the user has requested data}

\item{weights}{vector, num, of inverse distances weights for each baro, calculated by \code{\link{marsFetchBaroData}}}
}
\value{
Output will be a single barometric pressure reading.
  If there is a baro at the target SMP, the reading will be from that baro.
  If not, and there are more than 5 baros with data,
  the reading will be an inverse distance-weighted
  interpolation of those readings.
  If there are fewer than 5 readings, return \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Returns an on-site barometric pressure reading, an interpolated barometric pressure reading, \code{NA},
 or a combination.
